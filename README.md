# ART 23AC: Project 10 - Media Mash Up

For this meta-media project, make use of an existing medium beyond its intended purpose. Use the medium to combine two otherwise unrelated ideas or cultural artifacts. 

One medium can bring together two disparate materials and synthesize them into a new whole.
